# ONE-BUTTON GAME

A simple one-button game like Flappy Bird.

## TODO

- Bug: horizontal spacing sometimes draws a pipe when it shouldn't
- Bug: Distance between current pipe y and previous pipe y should be an achievable distance
- Bug: Collision detection is off, try drawing collision shapes
- Sound FX
- Music
- Juice
- Title screen
- Power ups
- Player animations
- Increase speed over time?
- Spawn static obstacles
- High-score (persistent)
- Name for high-scores

### Bugs

- I don't think the offscreen looping of obstacles is _perfect_. Do we need a buffer column?
